# :zap: Installation

The package is available on npm.

```bash
npm i -s react-lazy-blur-image
```

# :zap: Usage

Just like `react-progressive-image` this component expects exactly one child which has to be a function.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import LazyImage from 'react-lazy-progressive-image';

const App = () => {
	return (
		<LazyImage placeholder={'http://example.com/placeholder.png'} uri={'http://example.com/src.png'}>
			{(src, style) => <img src={src} style={style} />}
		</LazyImage>
	);
};
```

The child which is a function will have access to `src` and `style` values as arguments and the user can decide how to use those values to render image styles. (This pattern is called render props or children props pattern)

| Render prop           | Description                                                                                      | Type    | Values                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| src                   | The src of the image being rendered                                                              | String  | Initially points to the placeholder image, then loads image and will then point to the source image |
| loading               | Whether the image is currently being loaded                                                      | Boolean | true/false                                                                                          |
| isVisible             | Whether the image is currently visible in the page. This is managed by `react-visibility-sensor` | Boolean | true/false                                                                                          |
| visibilitySensorProps | Props to pass to `react-visibility-sensor` . Handy for `partialVisibility`                       | Object  | `undefined` or `{}`                                                                                 |

### Example usage with styled-components

You can use `styled-components`, to transition an image from the placeholder when the image has loaded.
You can use the `render props` as mentioned above and then use it to animate the `opacity` of the image from `0.2` to `1` when the image is loaded. This is , of course, a basic example. But you can use this logic to create more powerful animations.

For eg :

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import LazyImage from 'react-lazy-blur-image';

const Image = styled.img`
	height: 450px;
	width: 800px;
	margin-top: 200px;
	display: block;
	transition: all 0.25s ease;
	opacity: ${props => (props.loading ? 0.2 : 1)};
`;

const Usage = () => {
	return (
		<LazyImage uri={'/assets/imageURL'} placeholder={'/assets/placeholderURL'}>
			{(src, style) => <Image src={src} style={style} />}
		</LazyImage>
	);
};
```

## How was this package made üîß

A good amount of code has been taken from <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-progressive-image">react-progressive-image</a>, the additions being the usage of <a href="https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor">react-visibility-sensor</a> to check if there is a need to load the image and making sure that the image doesn't load in advance when it's not really needed.
